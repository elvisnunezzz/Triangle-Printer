Below is a sample README file for a Java project developed by Elvis Nunez. The project involves prompting the user for the number of rows and then printing two triangles based on the input.

# Triangle Printer

## Developer
Elvis Nunez

## Project Description
This Java program prompts the user for the number of rows and prints two separate triangles based on the provided input. The triangles are designed to demonstrate simple loop structures in Java and provide a visual output of star patterns.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure that Java is installed on your system by running `java -version` in your command line.
2. Download the source code from the repository or clone it with:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
4. Compile the Java program using:
   ```
   javac TrianglePrinter.java
   ```
5. Execute the compiled program:
   ```
   java TrianglePrinter
   ```

## Usage
- When prompted, input the number of rows you wish for each triangle.
- The program will print two triangles:
  - The first triangle will be aligned to the left.
  - The second triangle will be aligned to the right.
- Both triangles will have the number of rows specified by the user.

## Example
```
Enter the number of rows: 4
Triangle 1:
*
**
***
****

Triangle 2:
   *
  **
 ***
****
```

The example above shows the output for 4 rows. Adjust the number of rows as necessary to see different patterns.

This program is ideal for learning about loops and string manipulation in Java. It also serves as a practical example of how to manage user inputs and simple text-based output.
